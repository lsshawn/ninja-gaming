# SvelteKit tutorial by The Net Ninja

This is an updated repo for "SvelteKit Crash Course Tutorial" by The Net Ninja.

View course here:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hpM9ARM59Ve3jqcb54dqiP.

I highly recommend this course for beginners.

There are some outdated features in the courses, namely:
1. Use named layout instead of nested '__layout.svelte'
2. SAAS processor
3. 'page' is context is replaced with 'params'
